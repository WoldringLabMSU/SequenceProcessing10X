# SequenceProcessing10X
This script is used to create chimeric Fab sequences from the 10xGenomics data. It requires as an input a CSV file containing 4 columns: the clonotype ID, the concatenated amino acid sequence of the framework and CDR regions (comprising the Variable Heavy and Light portions of the Fab), the number of reads for each sequence, and the chain ID (IGK, IGH, IGL, etc).
